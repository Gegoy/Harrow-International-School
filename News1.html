            <h2>Kaleidoscope</h2>
            <p align="justify">Rena explains in her own words:<br><br>“I wrote this piece in response to the prompt ‘In an ever-changing world, when was the time you explored an unfamiliar identity? How have your experiences shaped your aspirations and your perspective on social or cultural identity?’ As a third culture kid myself, I drew on my own experiences and what I’ve come to learn throughout the years. I expressed my own view that while it is often reinforced and suggested to us that our identities have to be monolithic or singular, in fact I believe that human beings are can be from more than one place or time, or that our identities contain multitudes - this I expressed with the metaphor of the kaleidoscope. I also believe that this has been instrumental in shaping me into a global citizen today.”<br><br><strong>Congratulations Rena!</strong></p>
            <h3>'Kaleidoscope' by Rena Rawanchaikul</h3>
            <p align="justify">One of my earliest memories was of my mother, warm fingers grasping my tiny hand as we crossed the road. A flash of colour, and fabric was floating down the street in an odd dance: lift and tilt, lift and tilt. The wind’s mischievous finger had unwound my mother’s veil from her head, and the Iranian morality police were on us in an instant.</p>
            <p align="justify">I remember bouncing into a dusty castle in Oman alongside my schoolmates, too young to keep still, as I explored rooms with old chests and carvings on the ceilings. I crouched by a hole in the wall that made for a window, playing pretend by peering out as if I were some Arabian princess of a bygone age.</p>
            <p align="justify">As I did my homework every day, I could hear the sounds of the Salat al-zuhr from the white-domed mosque nearby. I frequented bazaars and shopping malls where women dressed in burkas and men in thawbs, and where the distinct smell of the Oud perfume flooded the hallways.</p>
            <p align="justify">A few years later, I would run in an entirely new land, one where I would climb trees and search for dandelions and dare to stand a few feet away from kangaroos in the wild. I would wake to the kookaburra’s laughter, analogous as ever to the free-spiritedness of then, a time where I would build sand castles and sneak into tree houses without a thought.</p>
            <p align="justify">And yet, not long after, I was back in the country where I spent my earliest years, its name stamped across my passport. At my international school, Thai culture and language reigned supreme amongst the students. I struggled to make sense of words I was now hearing on a daily basis, to mold my tongue into odd shapes; to speak in a language I had only ever associated with domestic settings. </p>
