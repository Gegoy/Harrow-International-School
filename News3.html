            <p align="justify">There cannot be a better example of collaboration than when 70 individual instrumentalists, with their individual musical talents, come together as an orchestra and collectively pool their skills, talents and musical know-how into the best possible example of working together collaboratively as a team to produce something greater than its individual parts. This was the case with the joint collaboration with Harrow UK’s visiting String Ensemble and the Harrow Bangkok Symphony Orchestra.</p>
            <p align="justify">In the first orchestral concert to be held in our newly opened Creative and Performing Arts Centre, we were treated to music by Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich and finally Gershwin’s Rhapsody in Blue, performed by SunSun Y13, Pun Y12 and Plub Y7. In addition, there was the serenity and beauty of a piano and violin collaboration with Bun and Noina’s performance of Korngold’s ‘Marietta’s Lied’, and of course, where would we be without audience participation as everyone sang the ‘Humming Chorus’ from Puccini’s Madame Butterfly with the accompanying orchestra conducted by the inimitable Richy Y13.</p>
            <p align="justify">The Harrow Strings Ensemble, under the direction of their Head of Strings – Mr. Dimitar Burov, also opened the second half of the concert with two beautifully crafted waltzes by Dvorak. The ensemble stayed through to the Monday and gave performances to the Year 4 instrumental programme, with a couple of opportunities for guest conductors selected from Year 4. It was a perfect end to a really successful musical collaboration.</p>
